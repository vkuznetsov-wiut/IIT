After several attempts, Cluckles finally rode the bike in a perfect circle.
The townsfolk cheered, tossing confetti and muffins in the air.
Cluckles caught a muffin mid-air and did a victory lap.
Inspired by his success, Cluckles decided to enter the Quirkville Talent Show.
His act: “Chicken on Wheels—A Muffin Musical.”
He recruited his best friends: Penny the pig, who played the tambourine, and Larry the llama, who juggled pineapples.
Rehearsals were chaotic. Penny kept eating the tambourine, and Larry’s pineapples kept rolling away.
Cluckles tried to keep everyone focused, but the muffins were too tempting.
On the day of the show, the trio arrived backstage, feathers, fur, and fluff everywhere.
The stage manager, a nervous squirrel named Nutters, handed Cluckles a microphone.
“Don’t drop it,” Nutters squeaked. “Last time, it rolled under the stage and started a squirrel disco.”
Cluckles winked. “No promises.”
The curtain rose, and the crowd gasped at the sight of a chicken on a bike, a pig with a half-eaten tambourine, and a pineapple-juggling llama.
The music started—an upbeat tune called “Muffin Mania.”
Cluckles pedaled in circles, Penny shook her tambourine (and nibbled it), and Larry juggled pineapples with surprising skill.
Suddenly, a muffin flew off the bike and landed in the mayor’s hat.
The mayor laughed, placing the muffin on his head like a crown.
The audience erupted in giggles.
Cluckles, feeling bold, attempted a daring stunt: riding the bike backwards while clucking the national anthem.
Penny joined in, oinking the harmony, and Larry balanced a pineapple on his nose.
The crowd was in stitches.
But then, disaster struck—a rogue pineapple bounced off the stage and hit the lights.
Ths or opening a chicken-run bakery.
The next morning, he woke up to find a line of animals outside his coop.
“Teach us to ride bikes!” they begged.
Cluckles agreed, starting the first-ever Quirkville Bike School.
His first student was a goldfish named Bubbles.
Bubbles had trouble pedaling, but Cluckles invented a water-powered bike.
Soon, Bubbles was zooming around in a fishbowl on wheels.
Next up was Gertrude the goat, who preferred to eat the handlebars.
Cluckles replaced them with carrot sticks, and Gertrude was happy.
what the actual fuck?
